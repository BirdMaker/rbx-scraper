If your Day 1 Retention is low or drops, that typically means that your new user experience needs to be improved. You might be losing new players early in your game because of confusing tutorials, user interfaces, lack of immediate rewards, or a too-steep immediate progression curve.",
    "Description.D7RetentionInsight": "Day 7 (D7) Retention is a good metric to track if you are hoping to make your game a daily habit - something they are motivated to play every day. If you have a low D7 retention, this may indicate an issue with engagement (new players aren't motivated to continue playing your game) or progression (players are either completing your content too quickly or taking too long to progress to the next meaningful reward).",
    "Description.D30RetentionInsight": "D30 retention helps you understand the effectiveness of converting new players to regular players.",

    "Description.RobuxInsight": "Revenue, or total Robux earned, is the easiest metric to track for monetization. Knowing how many of your players are willing to pay money in your game and how much your players are willing to spend, among other key metrics, will allow you to understand the health of the monetization in your game and to adjust your monetization strategy more effectively.",
    "Description.ARPUInsight": "ARPDAU is one of the key metrics to track for monetization. You can understand the value of each player in your game and use it to estimate the change in revenue you’ll see as your DAU and MAU change over time.",
    "Description.ARPPUInsight": "ARPPU focuses on the players who are willing to pay for your game and is most useful when considered alongside your conversion rate. Players who buy something in your game once are often more likely to buy again. A high ARPPU typically means that your paying players are finding high, repeat value in your game and is also indicative of high player engagement.",
    "Description.PayingUsersInsight": "Understanding what’s valuable in your game to players can help you figure out what to sell, how to set prices for players with varying wallet sizes, and how to design progression and economy to encourage that first purchase, and then to create longer-term paying users.",
    "Description.ConversionRateInsight": "ARPDAU and ARPPU are most useful when considered alongside your conversion rate. Conversion rate reflects how well you are able to motivate players to spend money in your game.  If you have a high conversion rate, for example, and a low ARPPU, that indicates that you are good at getting players to buy at least one item in your game, but that there is little beyond that initial purchase that inspires further spending. Understanding what is inspiring that first-time purchase and examining its value could help you determine what content you need to create to inspire more purchases.",
